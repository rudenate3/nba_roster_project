# NBA Roster Project

This project provides an opportunity to showcase your coding and web
design skills for the PrizePicks team. You will build a web interface
utilizing React & Redux that displays all NBA teams and their respective
players in a roster format including player's names, position and
any additional stats available through the provied API. Creative
display of the player & team information is encouraged.

It's preferable to use Git for managing your project source code
and the final deliverable can be provided via an archived email
attachment or via a Github/Gitlab repository. Time commitment for
this project is not restricted, although we estimate a time investment
of around 2 hours.
